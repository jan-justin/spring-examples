# Spring Boot Custom Autoconfiguration Example

This project demonstrates how to create, and test, a 
[custom Spring Boot autoconfiguration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.developing-auto-configuration).

Note that there is more to a Spring Boot autoconfiguration than is demonstrated here, such as dependency management 
through [Spring Boot Starters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.developing-auto-configuration.custom-starter), 
[conditionals](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.developing-auto-configuration.custom-starter),
and the nuances of autoconfiguration ordering.
